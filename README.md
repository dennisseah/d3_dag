# d3_dag

Yet another sample code for visualizing directed acyclic graph with D3.js. Credit to [Force directed graph for D3.js v4 with labelled edges and arrows](http://bl.ocks.org/fancellu/2c782394602a93921faff74e594d1bb1) from [Dino Fancellu](https://bl.ocks.org/fancellu). I used his code as baseline.

# Running it

enter `python3 -m http.server 8000`
and point your browser to `http://localhost:8000`
